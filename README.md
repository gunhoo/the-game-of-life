# the-game-of-life
2-2 OOP Final Project

17/11/23
Just finished the basic part of "Grid", "Load", "Store" class.
    1. Have to handle the exception.
    2. ~~Build GameOfLife class to connecte whole system~~
    3. ~~build a better algorithm~~
    4. Have to find a way to call the File Dialog for load and save.

 It's fine to refine or modify the classes and functions if you need.
